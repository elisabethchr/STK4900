### Horseshoe crabs
We are here studying how explanatory variables such as a female crab’s color, spine condition, weight and carapace width can affect the
amount of *satellites* fertilizing the eggs of a female besides its partner.

### Olympics
We are here studying whether or not the claim that athletes from countries with a larger population and higher GDP are more likely to
win medals than countries with a smaller population size and lower GDP.

### Randomized clinical trial
here, we are studying whether or not patients treated with the hormone prednisone had better cance at survival than patients who got an 
inactive placebo treatment. The different factors considered in this study are which treatment the patients are getting, their gender,
their age as well as the degree of ascites at beginning of the treatment.
