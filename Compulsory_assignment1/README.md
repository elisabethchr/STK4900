# Mandatory assignment 1
This is the first compuslory exercise in the course STK4900 at UiO. This project contains an analysis of air pollution at a certain location,
and blood pressure of three test groups.

## Air pollution
We are here studying how the air pollution at Alnabru in Olso is affected by different explanatory variables such as traffic volume
and meteorological conditions at the same place. The data set consists of 500 observations collected by the Norwegian Public Roads
Administration (Vegvesenet).

## Blood pressure
We are here studying the relation between blood pressure and age. This is done by analyzing random samples of blood pressure between 
three different age groups, each consisting of 12 men.
